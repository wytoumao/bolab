## 👋 Hi, I'm Bo

A QA engineer in the blockchain industry.

Currently a Senior QA Engineer at Bybit, previously at NetEase Games working on Marvel Rivals. Over the past few years, I've been deeply involved in integration testing for 40+ blockchains, covering EVM, UTXO, and various other architectures.

## Why Start a Blog?

Three reasons:

**1. Systematize scattered experience**

After testing so many chains and hitting countless edge cases, all that knowledge lives in my head. Writing it down forces me to organize my thinking.

**2. Build a searchable portfolio**

A single line on a resume saying "40+ chain integration testing experience" is far less convincing than a few in-depth articles.

**3. Document the journey**

Tech changes, the industry evolves, and so does my thinking. Recording it now will be interesting to look back on.

## What Will I Write About?

- 🔗 **Blockchain Testing** — Chain integration, wallet testing, smart contract testing
- 🧪 **Testing Methodology** — HTSM, risk-based testing, exploratory testing
- 🤖 **AI + Testing** — Exploring how AI can boost testing efficiency
- 💡 **Tech Musings** — Tools, learning notes, industry thoughts

## Let's go

This blog is just getting started. If you're also working in blockchain QA or interested in testing methodology, stay tuned.
